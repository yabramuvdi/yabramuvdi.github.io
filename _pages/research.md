I am currently working with professor Stephen Hansen to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. Some of our main projects include:

- Developing  NLP models to predict the presence of remote work on more than 500 million job postings. We showcase our current model through a web application hosted on HuggingFace. [Go to web application.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yabramuvdi/wfh-app-v2)
- Characterizing firms within a trade network through the use of embedding models.
- Measuring the evolution of economic uncertainty with word embeddings.
