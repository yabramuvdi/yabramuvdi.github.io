## Predoctoral research

I am currently working with professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. Some of our main projects include:

- Developing  NLP models to predict the presence of remote work on more than 500 million job postings. We are currently preparing a manuscript but the language model used to identify remote work can be tested online [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yabramuvdi/wfh-app-v2).
- Characterizing firms within a trade network through the use of embedding models. [Here](https://yabramuvdi.github.io/files/YM_cesifo_poster.pdf) is a poster I presented at [CESifo Venice Summer Institute 2022](https://www.cesifo.org/en/event/2022-07-01/venice-summer-institute-2022-using-novel-methods-and-data-applied-microeconomic).
- Measuring the evolution of economic uncertainty with word embeddings estimated on high-frequency news.
- Demonstrating multiple methods for algorithmic text analysis in economics for the Annual Review of Economics. [Code] and [current draft](https://sekhansen.github.io/pdf_files/text_algos_econ.pdf).

I have also been collaborating with professor [Andrés Álvarez](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/alvarez) in projects related to measuring income inequality and social mobility in Colombia. Some of our projects include:
- Using modern language models (e.g. GPT-3, BLOOM) to extract family relationships from Colombian historical records. I illustrate this in a blog post [here](https://yabramuvdi.github.io/relationships_extraction/).
- Developing a demo web application for the Inter-American Development Bank in order to estimate and visualize the distributional effects of macroeconomic shocks to different sectors of the economy. You can find the demo [here](https://obscure-tundra-95611.herokuapp.com/).
- Developing a simple web application that allows people to locate their household within Colombia's income distribution. You can find the demo [here](https://piracy-reality-whiskey-y1uf.herokuapp.com/).

## Master's

As part of my master program in Data Science at the Barcelona School of Economics I wrote a short group thesis analyzing the political discourse on Twitter of politicians participating in the 2017 elections from Germany, France and UK. We used a [Structural Topic Model](https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/) in order to understand the main drivers of the narratives used by political parties. You can find the final version of the document [here](https://yabramuvdi.github.io/files/Master_Thesis.pdf).

## Undergraduate research

During my undergraduate at Universidad de los Andes I worked with professor [Adriana Camacho](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/camacho) performing data analysis to better understand public policy issues related to poverty, health and education in Colombia. Some of our main projects included:

- Developing econometric models with panel data to understand the causal effect of a health policy intervention in Bogotá. [Working paper](https://sistemas.colmex.mx/Reportes/LACEALAMES/LACEA-LAMES2019_paper_661.pdf).
- Studying the evolution of household poverty in Colombia through a longitudinal survey. [Article in Spanish](https://encuestalongitudinal.uniandes.edu.co/es/publicaciones/colombia-en-movimiento/2017).
