# About me

I am a predoctoral researcher in economics and machine learning at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://datascience.bse.eu/team/yabra-muvdi/) where I work with  professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. I am particularly interested in studying how modern statistical methods combined with new sources of data can enrich the understanding of public policy issues. Within this broad interest, I am especially drawn to the study of **income inequality** and **social mobility** through the lense of **text and network data**. 

Being mostly an empirical researcher, I like to reflect on the biases present in the data I use and the ethical and politcal assumptions of the models I develop. Recently I have been thinking about this in the context of machine learning and the literature on fairness and bias. I also enjoy teaching and have done it at different levels and in multiple areas. 

Before moving to Barcelona for my master's degree, I worked for two years at [Instiglio](https://www.instiglio.org/) -a social enterprise focused on the design of innovative financial mechanisms to improve the impact of social programs- where I analyzed data to inform these designs. I would always want my work to contribute directly or indirectly to global development.

I hold an Msc in Data Science from the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/), and a BA in Economics from [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/).
