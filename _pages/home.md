I am an Economist and Data Scientist interested in exploring how diverse statistical and computational methods can enrich the understanding of complex and relevant problems while contributing to their solution. Ethical, political and philosophical discussions.

I am currently a predoctoral research assistant working with professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. Before, I finished a master's in Data Science at the Barcelona School of Economics and worked for almost two years in international development.
