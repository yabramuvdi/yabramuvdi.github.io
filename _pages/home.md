# About me

I am a predoctoral researcher in economics and machine learning at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://datascience.bse.eu/team/yabra-muvdi/) where I work with  professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis.

I am particularly interested on the study of income and gender inequalities. My hope is that studying these issues will show us ways to do things differently :crossed_fingers:. Being mostly an empirical researcher, I also like to reflect on the ethical and philosophical foundations of empirical methods. What underdlying assumptions about the world are different empirical methods using? Recently I have been thinking about this in the context of machine learning and the literature on fairness and bias.

Before moving to Barcelona, I worked for two years at [Instiglio](https://www.instiglio.org/) - a social enterprise focused on the design of innovative financial mechanisms to improve the impact of social programs- where I analyzed data to inform these designs.

I hold an Msc in Data Science from the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/), and a BA in Economics from [University of Los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/).
