# About me

I'm a predoctoral researcher in economics and machine learning at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://datascience.bse.eu/team/yabra-muvdi/) where I work with professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis.

I'm mainly interested in three areas of research all of which are centered around issues of **inequality**: <br>
- Using modern statistical methods and new sources of data to enrich the understanding of income inequality, inequality of opportunity, and social mobility.
- Studying how the increased use of algorithmic decision-making systems affects existing inequalities and potentially generates new ones.
- Understanding how different notions of fairness can be formalized and applied to algorithmic decision-making and assess their distributional effects. <br>

*I'm currently looking for PhD. positions that will allow me to do research in these areas.*

I hold an Msc in Data Science from the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/), and a BA in Economics from [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/). Before moving to Barcelona, I worked for two years at [Instiglio](https://www.instiglio.org/) -a social enterprise focused on the design of innovative financial mechanisms to improve the impact of social programs- where I analyzed data to inform these designs. I also enjoy teaching and have done it at different levels and in multiple areas.
