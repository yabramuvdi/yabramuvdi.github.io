# About me

I am an economist and data scientist with experience using methods from machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to contribute to the understanding of problems in a wide variety of fields. At the moment, I'm searching for opportunities to build ML/AI solutions for impactful use cases with an interdisciplinary team of people from which I can learn.

I have worked at various academic institutions (ETH ZÃ¼rich, UCL, and the Barcelona School of Economics) doing research in machine learning, NLP, and economics, as well as working as a freelance consultant developing solutions for clients. I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from the Barcelona School of Economics and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad de los Andes. I greatly enjoy teaching and have delivered multiple courses on NLP. Check my [teaching page](https://yabramuvdi.github.io/teaching/) for more info.
