# About me

I am an economist and data scientist with experience using methods from machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to contribute to the understanding of problems in a wide variety of fields. At the moment, I am particularly drawn to studying the risks introduced by deploying algorithmic decision-making systems in high-​stake environments (e.g. labor market, criminal law, credit scoring) and developing methods to mitigate these risks. 

Currently, I work as a Ph.D. researcher at the Data Science, Economics, and Law group at ETH Zürich where I am also a member of the AI Center. Before joining ETH Zürich, I was a predoctoral researcher in machine learning, NLP, and economics at UCL and the Barcelona School of Economics where I worked with Professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. 

I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from the Barcelona School of Economics and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad de los Andes. Back in Colombia, I worked in the international development sector doing data analysis to inform the design of social programs.

I also enjoy teaching and have delivered multiple courses on machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference. Check my [teaching page](./teaching.md) for more info.
