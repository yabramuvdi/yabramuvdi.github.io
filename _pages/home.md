# About me

I'm a Ph.D. student at ETH Zürich's Law, Economics, and Data Science Group under the supervision of professor [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/). I'm mainly interested in studying how algorithmic decision-making systems, when deployed in high-​stake environments (e.g. criminal law, credit scoring, job search), affect existing inequalities.

Before joining ETH Zürich I was a predoctoral researcher in economics and machine learning at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://datascience.bse.eu/team/yabra-muvdi/) where I worked with professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. 

I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/) and a B.A. in Economics from [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/). Back in Colombia, I worked in the international development sector doing data analysis to inform the design of social programs.

I also enjoy teaching. I have delivered practical courses on machine learning, natural language processing, and economics.
