# About me

I am a predoctoral researcher in economics and machine learning at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://datascience.bse.eu/team/yabra-muvdi/) where I work with  professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis.

I am particularly interested on the study and quantification of inequalities (e.g. income, gender, migration).

I hold an Msc in Data Science from the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/), and a BA in Economics from [University of Los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/). Before moving to Barcleona, I worked for two years at [Instiglio](https://www.instiglio.org/) - a social enterprise focused on the design of innovative financial mechanisms to improve the impact of social programs- where I analyzed data to inform these designs.
