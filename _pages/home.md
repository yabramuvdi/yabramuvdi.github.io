# About me

I am an Economist and Data Scientist interested in exploring how diverse statistical and computational methods can enrich the understanding of complex and relevant problems while contributing to their solution. 

Ethical, political and philosophical discussions related to statistics and machine learning.

I am currently a predoctoral researcher working with professor [Stephen Hansen](https://sekhansen.github.io/) to build models and tools for the use of unstructured data in economic analysis. Before, getting my master's in Data Science at the Barcelona School of Economics, I worked for two years in the international development sector where I analyzed data to inform the creation and implementation of multiple social programs.
